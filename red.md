Excellent idea. A good README.md file is essential for any professional project. It explains what the project does, how to set it up, and how to use it.

Here is a comprehensive README.md file formatted in Markdown. You can create a file named README.md in your project folder and paste this content directly into it.

(If you are not using Git, simply download and extract the project folder.)

2. Configure the Bot

The bot is configured using the config.json file.

Find config.json:

Get Telegram Credentials:

Log in to my.telegram.org.

Go to "API development tools" to find your api_id and api_hash.

Create a Bot on Telegram:

Start a chat with @BotFather.

Use the /newbot command and follow the prompts.

BotFather will give you a bot_token.

Update config.json:

Replace the placeholder values in config.json with your real credentials.

3. Build the Docker Image

Open a terminal in the project's root directory (where the Dockerfile is located) and run the build command. This will create a local Docker image named muxer-bot with all dependencies installed.

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less

docker build -t muxer-bot .
4. Run the Bot

Now, start the bot using the image you just built.

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
docker run --rm --name MuxerBotContainer -v $(pwd):/app muxer-bot

Command Breakdown:

docker run: The command to start a new container.

--rm: Automatically remove the container when it stops. This is great for keeping your system clean.

--name MuxerBotContainer: Assigns a memorable name to your running container.

-v $(pwd):/app: Mounts the current directory (your project folder) into the container at the /app path. This means that:

Log files (mux_bot.log) will be saved directly to your host machine.

You can edit bot.py or config.json on your host machine and simply restart the container for changes to take effect, without needing to rebuild the image every time.

muxer-bot: The name of the image to use.

The bot is now running! You should see log output in your terminal.

ðŸ¤– How to Use the Bot

/start: Start a chat with your bot and use this command. It will display the welcome message and instructions.

Send Files: Send your files to the bot in any order. The bot will recognize them and confirm what it has received.

Video: Send one video file (.mkv, .mp4, etc.).

Audio: Send one audio file (.mp3, .aac, etc.).

Subtitles: Send one or more subtitle files (.srt, .ass).

Thumbnail: Send one image as a photo.

(Optional) /metadata: Before sending the audio file, you can set its metadata.

Format: /metadata lang=<3-letter-code> title="<Your Title>"

Example: /metadata lang=hin title="Official Hindi Dub"

/mux: When you have sent all the files you want to include, use this command. The bot will:

Generate a thumbnail if you didn't provide one.

Process and mux all the files.

Upload the final, cleanly named .mkv file.

/cancel: Use this command at any point to completely reset your session and delete all associated temporary files.
